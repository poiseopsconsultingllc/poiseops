    <h2 class="section-title">Why PoiseOps exists</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      PoiseOps started with a simple question: what if your workday did not have to feel like constant catch up.
    </p>

    <div class="about">
      <div class="about-block">
        <p>
          Before launching PoiseOps, I spent more than a decade in grants, finance and accounting inside universities and
          schools of medicine. I lived in the world of sponsored projects, shifting requirements, tight deadlines and messy
          handoffs between departments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over those years, I became the systems person by necessity. I built and fixed workflows in Excel, Power Query, SQL,
          Power BI and Tableau, then moved into Python, AI and automation to stop doing the same manual tasks over and over.
        </p>
        <p>
          PoiseOps is the result of that journey — a way to use what I learned to make other people’s workdays calmer,
          clearer and more sustainable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I come from a military family and I have a deep respect for people who serve and for the people who keep public,
          grant funded and community work going behind the scenes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="about-block">
        <p><strong>Why work with PoiseOps.</strong></p>
        <ul class="about-list">
          <li><strong>I have lived on your side of the screen.</strong> I understand grants, budgets, sponsors, finance and reporting from the inside.</li>
          <li><strong>I speak both money and machines.</strong> I connect real-world constraints with tools like Python, SQL, Excel, Power Automate, Power BI and Tableau.</li>
          <li><strong>I build on what you already use.</strong> Outlook/Gmail, Google Workspace and your existing data are the starting point.</li>
          <li><strong>The goal is poise, not more hustle.</strong> More control and breathing room, less noise.</li>
          <li><strong>You get founder attention.</strong> The same person who listens designs, builds, and tunes the system.</li>
          <li><strong>Pricing is right-sized.</strong> Projects that pay for themselves in time saved and reduced overhead.</li>
        </ul>
